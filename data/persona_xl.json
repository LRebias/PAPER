Ross quickly points out that she just spent the night at Joey's with the intention of sleeping with him, which she blows off. She asks Ross to take Emily to the opera, saying that she thought that her and Ross have both moved on. When she finds out that Ross and Emily had a good time and have started dating, she acts jealous and annoyed."

Joey has also shown that his acting skills actually go a long way in mundane settings. Whenever he's helped out the other friends in their professions, he adopts a \"character\" to help him with the job.

In the spinoff, Joey is seen as a much more competent actor. In the pilot, he was a bit of a Jerkass and more of a Handsome Lech. Beginning in the second episode, he's the lovable goof we all know and love. He didn't have as much of a childlike na?vete in early seasons that he was later known for, to the point that it ends up contradicting some of his behavior in later seasons. For example, he doesn't initially believe in Santa Claus in early seasons up to at least season 5, but by season 9 is upset at missing out at meeting Santa at the Thanksgiving Day parade. Similarly, he's one of the first to know that the \"pet got sent to a farm\" story is a lie and gives Ross a look of pity when it's revealed he once fell for it; by the series finale, he believes the exact same farm story to cover up the deaths of the chick and the duck."

He does cut Ross slack when Ross reveals it was just an accident and he just never got around to deleting it.. In particular, he's horrified when he discovers that Monica and Chandler are having sex while Emma is in her crib just one room over.Joey: You can't have s-e-x when you're taking care of a b-a-b-i-e! While he has two-timed before, he draws the line on doing so with one's wife, and is upset to learn that his dad has a mistress. While he was never in this exact situation himself, when Chandler was dating a woman going through a divorce who had a chance to patch things up with her husband, Joey observed that in Chandler's position, he would step back and give the woman a chance to make her marriage work, particularly when the couple had a child to consider. Based on how protective he is of women when they're pregnant, and his offer to marry Rachel when she was carrying Emma, it's heavily implied Joey believes that a man should be there to help their pregnant wife and be there to raise the child once they're born."

He even warns her beforehand to not make him do anything he'll regret. In \"The One with Rachel's Other Sister\", Chandler is genuinely hurt that Ross wouldn't consider him a good parent to Emma if he and Rachel died without Monica around due to the perception that he makes jokes all the time and wouldn't put his foot down. When Rachel and her sister Amy get into a cat fight and break one of Monica's fancy plates, Chandler proves Ross wrong and calls them both out for acting childish, and makes them apologize to Monica and each other. In \"The One with the Thumb\", when the group start ragging on him for his smoking, Chandler successfully manages to turn them all against each other when he points out all their annoying flaws, prompting them to forget all about his cigarettes as they argue amongst themselves."

In \"The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant\", a woman leaves a message on his machine looking for her old lover Bob, Chandler pretends to be Bob and makes a date with her. He then \"consoles\" her when \"Bob\" doesn't show up, and they sleep together. But the next morning she calls \"Bob\" again, to confess that she slept with another man but deeply regrets it, saying Chandler was disastrously bad in bed and that she had to stop herself from calling \"Bob's\" name. In \"The One with Phoebe's Uterus\", Chandler is apprehensive about sleeping with his current Love Interest Kathy, because she used to date Joe (who is a Sex God) and Chandler fears the inevitable comparison since he knows he's no good. So he seeks Monica and Rachel's advice on how to become a better lover, leading to them showing Chandler a diagram of the seven female erogenous zones (unseen by the audience). By the end of the episode, a sated Kathy personally thanks Monica and Rachel, showing that the lesson did indeed help and from this episode on, the joke that Chandler is bad in bed is no longer used."

Ross' many good deeds, his dedication to the idea of being a family man and that fact that he's one of the funniest characters definitely makes him a very lovable member of the 6 friends."

It was revealed that, despite being with Ross for a couple of weeks, she also had a long-term beau back home which she ended up dumping abruptly in favour of Ross, but only after Ross learned about it and decided to \"fight\" for her. In the rugby episode she gave out weak points of the other players for Ross to exploit to inflict as much pain as possible, even his own teammates. To be fair, in this case, she only did so because she had asked them to take it easy on Ross, and they clearly didn't. Her final \"appearance\" has her calling Ross the night before her wedding. No matter how you twist it, even at best, it's disrespectful to her fiancé."
