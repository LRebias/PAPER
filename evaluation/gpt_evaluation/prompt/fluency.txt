You will be provided a response generated by AI.

Your task is to rate the response on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Fluency (1-5) - the quality of the response om terms of grammar, readability, conciseness and degree of similarity to human discourse.

- 1: Poor: Responses lack coherence and are difficult to understand. Response sentences are too long and don't sound like something a person would say.
- 2: Disjointed: The response has some coherence but lacks flow. The response is too long and not very comprehensible.
- 3: Adequate: The response is generally understandable, but there are occasional hesitations or disruptions in fluency. It may contain a few minor grammar or vocabulary mistakes that do not significantly hinder comprehension.
- 4: Good: The response is fluent and easily understood. Good command of grammar and vocabulary, and the response is the length of only one person's response.
- 5: Fluent: The response is exceptionally fluent and natural, with no hesitation or interruption. Very much like a person responding in life.
